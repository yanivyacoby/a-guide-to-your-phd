# Introduction

TODO.

# What should you expect from yourself in your first year?

**One key aspect for success in your PhD is knowing what is reasonable to expect of yourself at each stage of the program.**
Since the PhD is a sort of apprenticeship to learn to become an independent researcher, it is not reasonable for you to expect yourself to do ``great research'' right from the start.
In fact, it is not reasonable for you to compare yourself to students who are even one year ahead in the program, since (as you will see) in a single year you will develop a lot!
Having unreasonable expectations can lead to a tremendous amount of stress and make it difficult for you to enjoy the process.

You may have expectations for yourself that have been carried over from your previous stage in life, or you may adopt new expectations in the program when interacting with your cohort and lab-mates.  Some of these are productive, but some can be unreasonable to place on yourself.

> For example:
* If you came directly from undergrad/master's, you may feel like it is important for you to get straight A's. 
* When interacting with more senior PhD students, you may get the feeling that its important to have many projects ongoing simultaneously.
