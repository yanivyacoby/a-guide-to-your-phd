# Introduction

TODO.

# What should you expect from yourself in your first year?

One key aspect for success in your PhD is **knowing what is reasonable to expect of yourself at each stage of the program**.
Since the PhD is a sort of apprenticeship to learn to become an independent researcher, 
it is not reasonable for you to expect yourself to do "great research" right from the start.
In fact, it is not reasonable for you to compare yourself to students who are even one year ahead in the program, 
since (as you will see) in a single year you will develop a lot!
Having unreasonable expectations can lead to a tremendous amount of stress and make it difficult for you to enjoy the process.

You may have expectations for yourself that have been carried over from your previous stage in life, 
or you may adopt new expectations in the program when interacting with your cohort and lab-mates.
Some of these are productive, but some can be unreasonable to place on yourself.

> For example:
* If you came directly from undergrad/master's, you may feel like it is important for you to get straight A's. 
* When interacting with more senior PhD students, you may get the feeling that its important to have many projects ongoing simultaneously.

While some of these expectations will be **helpful and attainable**, some will be **unreasonable** and may cause you **unnecessary stress**.
In this section, we list some common (and often unreasonable) expectations incoming students might have for themselves, as well as reasonable alternatives. 
Since every students' experience is different, you may relate to many of these, only some, or none at all, 
but we hope they will at least get you to think about what expectations you may have for yourself and whether or not they are sensible.

## What you think your project is about vs. what it's actually about

Research problems are often posed to be very **specific**, but they are pitched in terms of their **broad implications**.
There can be a stark difference between the day-to-day work and the promised broader impact of the research. 
The day-to-day work is often more tedious and difficult, filled with lots of trial and error, dead ends and uncertainty.

> As an example, a project to understand a specific type of mechanism in cancerous cells may help one day lead to a cure, 
but the day-to-day work involves a difficult and long process of data collection, wet-lab work, etc.

While it is good to practice pitching your project in the most impressive way possible (to prepare for future job interviews, for instance), 
it is good to notice how it comes across to others, and to notice how you perceive others’ projects. 
It is easy to feel like everyone else’s research projects are significantly more interesting than your project, 
and to forget that you can easily cause a peer to feel like their research is boring in comparison to your research. 

**Staying excited:** _It is unreasonable to expect your day-to-day work to be exciting in the same sort of way the broader implications are exciting._
The broader implications are tailored to excite everyone -- 
anyone can get excited about a cure for cancer, a robot that walks, etc.
Excitement about the day-to-day work comes from different sources; 
for some it may come from a deep curiosity for the particular 
(and perhaps obscure) thing they are studying, for some the tasks themselves are enjoyable. 
Investing the time to find what excites you most about your work can help you if you ever find yourself losing momentum.
Most grad students will find themselves at least several times in their PhD unexcited about their project, and that is perfectly natural.
The good news is though, that **excitement is a skill** one can to work on.
We therefore recommend that if you start noticing yourself feeling this way, 
talk to your advisors and lab-mates and see what works for them!

> Additional things to try include,
* Switching between different research projects or between research and class-work when you feel like you are losing momentum ("productive procrastination"). 
* Reminding yourself of how your research contributes to the bigger picture.
