# Introduction

TODO.

# 1. What should you expect from yourself in your first year?

One key aspect for success in your PhD is **knowing what is reasonable to expect of yourself at each stage of the program**.
Since the PhD is a sort of apprenticeship to learn to become an independent researcher, 
it is not reasonable for you to expect yourself to do "great research" right from the start.
In fact, it is not reasonable for you to compare yourself to students who are even one year ahead in the program, 
since (as you will see) in a single year you will develop a lot!
Having unreasonable expectations can lead to a tremendous amount of stress and make it difficult for you to enjoy the process.

You may have expectations for yourself that have been carried over from your previous stage in life, 
or you may adopt new expectations in the program when interacting with your cohort and lab-mates.
Some of these are productive, but some can be unreasonable to place on yourself.

> **For example:**
* If you came directly from undergrad/master's, you may feel like it is important for you to get straight A's. 
* When interacting with more senior PhD students, you may get the feeling that its important to have many projects ongoing simultaneously.

While some of these expectations will be **helpful and attainable**, some will be **unreasonable** and may cause you **unnecessary stress**.
In this section, we list some common (and often unreasonable) expectations incoming students might have for themselves, as well as reasonable alternatives. 
Since every students' experience is different, you may relate to many of these, only some, or none at all, 
but we hope they will at least get you to think about what expectations you may have for yourself and whether or not they are sensible.

## What you think your project is about vs. what it's actually about

Research problems are often posed to be very **specific**, but they are pitched in terms of their **broad implications**.
There can be a stark difference between the day-to-day work and the promised broader impact of the research. 
The day-to-day work is often more tedious and difficult, filled with lots of trial and error, dead ends and uncertainty.

> **As an example**, a project to understand a specific type of mechanism in cancerous cells may help one day lead to a cure, 
but the day-to-day work involves a difficult and long process of data collection, wet-lab work, etc.

While it is good to practice pitching your project in the most impressive way possible (to prepare for future job interviews, for instance), 
it is good to notice how it comes across to others, and to notice how you perceive others’ projects. 
It is easy to feel like everyone else’s research projects are significantly more interesting than your project, 
and to forget that you can easily cause a peer to feel like their research is boring in comparison to your research. 

**Staying excited:** _It is unreasonable to expect your day-to-day work to be exciting in the same sort of way the broader implications are exciting._
The broader implications are tailored to excite everyone -- 
anyone can get excited about a cure for cancer, a robot that walks, etc.
Excitement about the day-to-day work comes from different sources; 
for some it may come from a deep curiosity for the particular 
(and perhaps obscure) thing they are studying, for some the tasks themselves are enjoyable. 
Investing the time to find what excites you most about your work can help you if you ever find yourself losing momentum.
Most grad students will find themselves at least several times in their PhD unexcited about their project, and that is perfectly natural.
The good news though, is that **excitement is a skill** one can to work on!
We therefore recommend that if you start noticing yourself feeling this way, 
talk to your advisors and lab-mates and see what works for them!

> **Additional things to try include**,
* Switching between different research projects or between research and class-work when you feel like you are losing momentum ("productive procrastination"). 
* Reminding yourself of how your research contributes to the bigger picture.


## Process vs. outcomes

You may look up to more experienced graduate students in your lab / at SEAS and expect yourself to be just like them: 
you may expect yourself to present work clearly, 
make consistent progress on research every week, 
have interesting / insightful observations about others' work at meetings, 
publish lots of papers, collaborate with lots of people, 
have a good work/life balance, etc.
Unfortunately, PhDs take a long time to complete for a good reason: 
you are not expected to come in with these skills -- you are expected to develop them over the course of the PhD.
While comparing yourself with more experienced students you admire may help you set goals, there is also a danger in doing that:
_it is easy to only notice their outcomes (exciting progress on research, insightful ideas) 
and forget that it took them conscious hard work over several years to get there._

In fact, if you only notice the outcomes, it may lead to an unproductive research process. 
Slow progress based on a methodical process can more constructively lead to 
publishable insights than quick attempts to jump right to an interesting result:

> **Example of an unproductive research process:**
Consider, for instance, student A, who has watched how their more senior lab-mates seemingly go from having no 
project to having a nearly complete paper with exciting results and broader implications. 
Student A tries to imitate: they try to go from nothing to everything in a single step. 
However, since such a research process rarely works, they end up getting negative results. 
They then find that they cannot process these negative results constructively, because they do not naturally lead to a hypothesis for why the experiment failed). Student A then feel inadequate in comparison to their lab-mates, and moreover does not ask for help because they feel like they would be wasting others' time.

> **Example of a productive research process:**
In contrast, consider student B, who does not compare themselves with more senior students and thus 
does not expect themselves to complete the whole project in one step.
Instead, they follow the advice of their advisor and try to understand where that advice is coming from, (even when it might seem annoying / tedious). 
They build a sequence of small-scale experiments, 
each with a clear hypothesis that can help determine the next best experiment to run. 
Slowly and methodically, with negative results leading constructively to new hypotheses and experiments, 
student B works up to a complete and publishable research project.

As a take-away, especially in your first year, 
we recommend focusing more on process and skills 
(learning background material, principled experimental design, communicating effectively), 
rather than on outcomes (ex. getting published).
The specific set of skills you have to learn depends on your lab and advisor. For specifics, see Section 2.


## Balancing research vs. classes

Coming especially directly from undergrad/master's, you may feel compelled to treat classes like you did before -- 
that is, you may feel that getting good grades and taking hard classes reflects your success in the program,
and may further help get you a good position when you graduate.
In grad school, this is only partially true.
If you're applying to fellowships, then grades do matter, but the difficulty of the classes does not necessarily matter.
Aside from that, however, _the emphasis is not on grades and classes, but on research_.
Therefore, so long as you learn the skills and tools necessary to do your research (as per your advisor's recommendation), 
we recommend you focus on learning and not on grades.

> **We compiled a list of tips** we hope you find useful to help balance classes and research (as well as personal life):
* Work on problem-sets with classmates. In many classes, the instructors even specifically say the problem-sets are designed to require collaboration!
* Go to office hours, and come prepared with questions after having already looked at and attempted the problems. 
* Try to align class projects with research -- some professors let you even combine your research with the class project.
* Take a research course with your advisor (ex. CS299r in Computer Science, AM299r in Applied Math, etc.), since in some departments you can count that as a class.
* Since classes have more defined expectations and research is open ended, it’s easy to pour more time into classes than into research. You can try setting limits on how much time you spend on each class per week. 



# 2. What does your advisor expect from you in your first year?

Your relationship with your advisor is a two-way street:
on one hand, you are expected carry out lab duties and push your research project forward, 
and on the other, your advisor is expected to provide you with the feedback and support you need to become an independent researcher.
As such, you need to make sure you're a productive member of lab (making your advisor happy), 
while you need to make sure you’re getting the support you need (making you happy). 
_Each advisor / lab will have different expectations_, 
and it is important you **communicate effectively** to determine what these expectations are and **how to meet these expectations**, 
while also ensuring you are getting the **help and support you need**. 
As a rule of thumb, we recommend you to be the one to manage your relationship with your advisor -- 
_to be proactive in seeking feedback, resources, advice, etc._ -- 
and generally to err on the side of asking more questions than less.
In this section, we go into more detail about several areas of conversation we recommend you to talk to your advisor about.
Since each advisor / lab are unique, these may not be 100% applicable to you, but we hope that this can help get you started!


## Soliciting feedback from your advisor

Some advisors give feedback regularly and some don't, and some advisors only give feedback on certain topics and not others.
As such, we recommend to periodically (every several weeks) schedule a one-on-on meeting with your advisor to solicit for feedback directly.
Some questions to ask your advisor include:

* Am I improving in the areas that I need to most? 
* What skill should I focus on most in the next couple of weeks? 
* How can I communicate better in group meetings?
* Are you overall happy with my performance? 
* How can I be a more supportive lab-mate? 

Asking for feedback will (1) help you stay focused and improve more quickly, 
(2) show your advisor initiative and desire to improve, and lastly, 
(3) it will help prevent problems of miscommunication / never leave you 
uncertain about whether your advisor is unhappy with you 
(ex. you would expect to pass your qualifying exam since you were proactive about improving in all the necessary areas).

Since you are just starting your PhD, be ready to get some constructive (negative-sounding) feedback -- 
it does not mean your advisor thinks you’re doomed to fail -- 
it means your advisor is trying to help you develop as a researcher.
In short, you are not expected to start out knowing everything, 
so you should expect to be getting constructive feedback!
